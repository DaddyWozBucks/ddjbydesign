      Since leaving the Island of Anglesey, North Wales, in 1984, at the age of 18, i feel privileged to have travelled extensively and to have met such a cross section of interesting people .
      </br> 
      I have been involved in, and run, several differed businesses, mainly property based.   The property business has changed  dramatically in the UK since I first did my first “deal”.  With so much information is available on line, property investment clubs, buy to let mortgages and other lending sources, for me a lot of  the ‘fun’ of the business has gone. ( As with a lot of things in life, sometimes I feel we should have just been content with what we had at the time. )   </br>
      Modern technology has changed life beyond recognition – when I first went to London in search of work  mobile phones were just being brought onto the market. </br>
      </br> 
      I have experienced life in may different “forms”  and lived in many different places,; my story is often listened to with disbelief !   There have been many ups and downs but this varied life suits me.    I am always enthusiastic about projects and believe strongly in helping others.   I am a great advocate of exercise and my skateboarding provides me with instant adrenalin ! </br>
      </br>
      Along the way I have been helped by very many people, too numerous to mention here, but I will always be grateful to them. </br>
      </br>
      If my life story interests you, and you are looking for a collaborator on any project, I would be very interested to hear from you. </br>
