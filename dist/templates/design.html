      Design has always interested me. Not that I'm a car enthusiast, but the design, both interior and exterior has changed considerably and always I'm surprised at the layout of the different cars and taxis I often find myself in.   And the design of the Parmesan grater has always been an Italian designers both dream and nightmare I feel! </br>
      </br>
       I have been lucky enough to have met several designers, from all aspects of design - art, computer, 3D, fashion etc etc. I am always happy to collaborate on a project should you have one in mind."
